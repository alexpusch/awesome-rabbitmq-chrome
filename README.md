RabbitMQ queues view can become unusable with many queues, especially if you're using the sharding plugin. This extension will add a new tab in RabbitMQs management console with an awesome view of your queues:

- Sharded queues will be collapsed to a single line
- The UI will alert you when queues have no consumers or has accumulated many messages
- Configurable alerts for specific queues.
- Filter each column
